# AI-Powered Web Homepage

This project demonstrates a Level 3 web development approach:
a conversion-focused web homepage combined with backend logic and Python-based AI or automation processing.

The goal is not to build a full SaaS product, but a realistic, end-to-end web application that can be used as:
- a portfolio project
- a client demo
- a foundation for MVPs or internal tools

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This web application is composed of three main layers:

1. **Frontend**  
   A modern, conversion-oriented homepage built with React, focused on clarity, structure, and user flow.

2. **Backend API**  
   A lightweight Node.js server that acts as a bridge between the frontend and the Python service.

3. **Python Service**  
   The core logic layer, responsible for AI processing, automation, or data handling.

User interaction flow:

Frontend (React)  
→ Backend API (Node.js)  
→ Python Service (AI / Automation)  
→ Backend Response  
→ Frontend Display

This modular separation keeps the system clean, maintainable, and extensible.
